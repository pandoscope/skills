# The glossary prune, one script for every repo the template stamps
# (AET#67, AET#203, AET#210).
#
# Every stamp re-delivers the shared term set and `disambiguate prune`
# removes what nothing links, so a repo keeps exactly the shared terms
# it references. The post-stamp task, the template-update workflow and
# the drift job all run this same script, and what it removed is
# committed with the update. The template repo runs it too, on every
# commit, with --fail-on-removal: there the glossary is render output
# the self-application test pins and README.md's index keeps reachable,
# so a removal is a defect, not convergence. The script then names the
# terms, restores the tracked ones so a commit hook never leaves the
# tree mutated, and exits 1.
#
# The pin is agentic_disambiguate_version: read from
# .copier-answers.agentic.yml in a stamped repo, from copier.yml's
# default in the template itself. disambiguate is pre-alpha; an unpinned
# run would float across breaking releases.
