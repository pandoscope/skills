"""Cap on what a source file costs to read, run over the files a commit
touches (#239, #242).

The cap is an estimated token count — file bytes / 4, rounded up —
because tokens are what an agent pays for a Read: comments and blank
lines count, and the language's density stops mattering. Complexity is
measured independently (ruff carries it for Python); for bash, which
ruff cannot read, this hook also counts code lines — non-blank,
non-comment — because a long bash script is a rewrite-in-Python signal
and a total measure would punish exactly the comments that make bash
safer.

A file over a cap fails, naming the path and the measure, unless the
repo's own `.file-length-allowlist` names it — each entry carrying the
ticket that will bring the file back under, so the list shrinks rather
than becoming permanent. Three things make an entry leave the list, all
checked here: a ticket is missing, the file came back under every cap
that applies to it, or the file is gone.

Stdlib only, and no repo state beyond the paths it is handed: prek runs
this on every commit, on whatever `python3` the contributor has.
